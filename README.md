# MolecularQM_Notebooks
MolecularQM_Notebooks is a repository for python code and other teaching material intended for an advanced undergraduate introduction to molecular quantum mechanics. This repository is currently a shell and a work in progress. Stay tuned for updates! Recommended instructor resource text is Szabo and Ostlund's _Modern Quantum Chemistry_. I am still looking for an appropriate student resource text. 

MolecularQM_Notebooks is intended for academic or personal use.
